# CONTRIBUTING

Contributions are welcome and contributors will be fully credited.

Please read and understand the contribution guide before creating an issue or pull request.

## Guidelines

* Please follow the [PSR-12 Coding Style Guide](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/), enforceable by [PHP-CS-FIXER](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer).
* Ensure that the current tests pass, and if you've added something new, add the relevant tests.
* Send a coherent commit history, making sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful.
* You may need to [rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing) to avoid merge conflicts.
* If you are changing the behavior, or the public api, you may need to update the docs.
* Don't forget to update the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md), specially if you added new functionality.
* Please remember that we follow [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
