## Procedure

Before filing an issue:

- If it's a bug, attempt to replicate the problem, to ensure that it wasn't a coincidental incident.
- If it's a feature request or a general discussion, check to make sure your it isn't already present within the project's discussions tab.
- Check the pull requests tab to ensure that the bug doesn't have a fix in progress or if the feature isn't already in progress.

Before submitting a pull request:

- Read the previous section and make sure all its items are false.
- Check the codebase to ensure that your feature doesn't already exist.
- Check the pull requests to ensure that another person hasn't already submitted the feature or fix.
